git merge vs rebase
Pass by Value and Pass by reference in JS

// delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName

// delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName

git config --list

Pass by Value :-
function Passbyvalue(a, b) {
let tmp;
tmp = b;
b = a;
a = tmp;
console.log(Inside Pass by value function -> a = ${a} b = ${b});
}

let a = 1;
let b = 2;
console.log(Before calling Pass by value Function -> a = ${a} b = ${b});

Passbyvalue(a, b);

console.log(After calling Pass by value Function -> a =${a} b = ${b});

Pass By Reference :-
function PassbyReference(obj) {
let tmp = obj.a;
obj.a = obj.b;
obj.b = tmp;

console.log(`Inside Pass By Reference 
    Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
}

let obj = {
a: 10,
b: 20

}
console.log(Before calling Pass By Reference Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b});

PassbyReference(obj)

console.log(After calling Pass By Reference Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b});

We are going to create a single HTML page where:

An end-user can add a todo item.

See the list of todos.

Update the status of a todo item.

Remove an item from the list

To achieve this, you need to take care of:

Proper input field types in your form

Validations

Your form fields are cleared once an item is added.

Removing item updates the page, and the item is no longer visible

Note: You need to use plain and simple Javascript to add functionalities to your page. No use of AJAX or JQuery expected.

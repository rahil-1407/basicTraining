Part 4 - Branch Basics

branch
checkout
cherry-pick
tag

Query: What exactly a branch mean? Is a branch a set of commits? Or is it a pointer?
One more query: Can we add one more commit to a tag?

git branch - They are simply pointers to a specific commit -- nothing more.
For now though, just remember that a branch essentially says "I want to include the work of this commit and all parent commits."

git cherry-pick - git cherry-pick <Commit1> <Commit2> <...>
It's a very straightforward way of saying that you would like to copy a series of commits below your current location (HEAD).

git tag - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=govmXpDGLpo
Tagging in git refers to create specific points in history for your repository

This is usually done to mark release points.
2 types : annotated tag and lightweight tag

git tag <Tag Name>
git tag -a v1.1 -m "Version 1.1 released"
git show <tag name>

Push to remote git push origin v1.1
git tag --delete <tag name>

Delete in remote
git push origin --delete v1.1

Tag and commit-id at that point refer to the same state of repository

We cannot checkout tags in git
We create a branch from the tag and checkout the branch
git checkout -b <branch-name> <tag-name>

Can we add one more commit to a tag?
No
Delete the tag. Make a new branch then add commit and then add a new tag

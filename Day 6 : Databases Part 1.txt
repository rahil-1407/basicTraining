Databases make data management easy. Database is a collectionn of data.
A table consists of rows and columns.

Data type - CHAR VARCHAR Boolean int
The only difference between TEXT and VARCHAR(n) is that you can limit the maximum length of a VARCHAR column, for example, VARCHAR(255) does not allow inserting a string more than 255 characters long.

In SQL, the keywords are the reserved words like SELECT

Review :- metadata, user, schema ?????

MetaData in DBMS :-
Relational databases store and provide access not only data but also metadata in a structure called data dictionary or system catalog. It holds information about:

tables,
columns,
data types,
table relationship,
constraints etc.

In Oracle, users and schemas are essentially the same thing. You can consider that a user is the account you use to connect to a database, and a schema is the set of objects (tables, views, etc.) that belong to that account.

user is an alias for current_user in POstgreSQL

Part 2 - SQL

DDL - CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME

DQL - SELECT

DML - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DDL is Data Definition Language which is used to define data structures. For example: create table, alter table are instructions in SQL. DML: DML is Data Manipulation Language which is used to manipulate data itself. For example: insert, update, delete are instructions in SQL.

The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

Truncate preserves the structure of the table for future use, unlike drop table where the table is deleted with its full structure.

Change the name of column NAME to FIRST_NAME in table Student.
ALTER TABLE Student RENAME COLUMN NAME TO FIRST_NAME;

The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';

The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

Part 1 - Variables

Data Types - string, boolean, number
Array
JS Object
Sample Query: What kind of Data Structure you can relate JS Object with?

const vs let vs var
JS Object - Hash Table

JavaScript Objects are Mutable.

Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

const person = {
firstName:"John",
lastName:"Doe",
age:50,
eyeColor:"blue"
}

const x = person;
x.age = 10; // Will change both x.age and person.age

The object x is not a copy of person. It is person. Both x and person are the same object.

Any changes to x will also change person, because x and person are the same object.

In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.

Review - Array and its internal functions (map, reduce, foreach etc)

map - const a = [1,2,3,4,5]

console.log(a.map(function(num){
    return num*2
}))
.map() is a non-mutating method that creates a new array as opposed to mutating methods, which only make changes to the calling array.

The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.
let numbers = [100,20,50,90]

console.log(numbers.reduce(function(total,num) {
    return total - num
}))

The forEach method passes a callback function for each element of an array
let numbers = [100,20,50,90]

console.log(numbers.forEach(function(num) {
    console.log(num)
}))

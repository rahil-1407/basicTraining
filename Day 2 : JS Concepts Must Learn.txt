Part 4: Concepts (Must Learn)

eventloop
variable scopes
callback
this
try catch (error Handling)

Sample Query: Can you write some sample codes for all these concepts?

Callback Function :-
setTimeout(function () {
console.log("Hello World")
}, 5000)

this Keyword in JS

Alone this refers to global object
In a regular function also it refers to global object.
In a method, it refers to the owner's object.

try Catch - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp

Scope of Variable is of 2 Types : Local and Global Scope

var vs let vs const

var - Function Scoped
let / const - Block Scoped

Event Loop - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9C7v6b32Q6Zp8kbZtw-1LKZ8H4wKcyapwQ3dJIFX6o/edit#heading=h.ktyznagco2

Review - variable scopes

(function () {
var a = b = 3
})();

console.log(a+" "+b)
b becomes a global variable here and a is block scoped variable
Above Function is Self Invoking Function

Review - bind, apply, arrow function
let name = {
firstname : "Rahil",
lastname : "Sinha"
}

//A common method
let printFullName = function(hometown, state) {
console.log(this.firstname+" "+this.lastname+ " " + hometown + " " +
state)
}

let name2 = {
    firstname : "Sachin",
    lastname : "Tendulkar"
}

//function borrowing
printFullName.call(name,"Hazaribagh","Jharkhand")

//Take other arguments as array
printFullName.apply(name2,["Mumbai","Maharastra"])

// Makes a copy of the method
let newMethod = printFullName.bind(name,"Hazaribagh", "Jharkhand")
newMethod()
